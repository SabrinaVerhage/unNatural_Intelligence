          As artificial intelligence advances at an unprecedented pace, we find ourselves in a state of numb anticipation, uncertain of its future role on this planet. At the same time, we are navigating a rapidly changing climate—raising questions about our own intelligence. Why do we value intelligence so highly, yet fail to care for an intelligent planet?

          Lichens could offer a small but profound inspiration. These remarkable lifeforms—ancient collaborations between fungi, algae, and bacteria—thrive in the harshest conditions, embodying resilience, patience, and balance. They are living proof that intelligence is not just about speed or computation but about adaptation, cooperation, and survival.<br>
          And yet, why do they so often go unnoticed?
